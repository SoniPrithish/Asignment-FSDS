    "The distinction between quantitative and qualitative data lies in the nature of the data and how it is represented and analyzed. Quantitative data can be manipulated mathematically, and statistical analysis can be performed on it. In contrast, qualitative data involves non-numerical categories, and analysis techniques focus on frequency counts, proportions, or qualitative interpretations.\n",

    "a) Missing data: Some data instances may have missing values, either due to data entry errors, incomplete data collection, or intentional non-response. This can lead to biased or inaccurate models if not handled properly.\n",

    "b) Outliers: Outliers are extreme values that deviate significantly from the majority of the data. They can distort the analysis and affect the model's performance.\n",
