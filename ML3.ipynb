    "Machine learning refers to the field of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It involves training models on large datasets to extract patterns or relationships and use them to make predictions or take actions on new, unseen data. Two machine learning applications in the business world are:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Fraud Detection: Machine learning algorithms can analyze large volumes of transaction data and detect patterns indicative of fraudulent activities. By learning from historical data, the models can identify suspicious patterns and flag potential fraud cases in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Customer Churn Prediction: Machine learning can help businesses predict and identify customers who are likely to churn or stop using their products or services. By analyzing customer behavior, demographics, and historical data, models can identify factors contributing to churn and enable targeted retention strategies.\n",
