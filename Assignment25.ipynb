    "The difference between enclosing a list comprehension in square brackets and parentheses lies in the type of object they create. When using square brackets, a list comprehension is created, resulting in a list object. On the other hand, when using parentheses, a generator comprehension is created, which produces a generator object.\n",

    "2. What is the relationship between generators and iterators?\n",
    "```\n",
    "Generators and iterators are closely related concepts. An iterator is an object that implements the iterator protocol, which consists of the __iter__() and __next__() methods. Iterators allow sequential access to a collection of items, retrieving one item at a time. Generators, on the other hand, are a specific type of iterator. They are created using generator functions or generator expressions and provide a convenient way to implement iterators. Generators yield values one at a time, allowing lazy evaluation and efficient memory usage.\n",

    "```\n",
    "The presence of the yield statement in a function is an indication that it is a generator function. A generator function is a special type of function that can be paused and resumed, producing a series of values through the use of the yield keyword. When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object that can be iterated over to retrieve the values yielded by the function.\n",

    "```\n",
    "The yield statement is used in generator functions to define the points at which the function should pause its execution and yield a value to the caller. It allows the function to produce a series of values one at a time, without fully executing the function and generating all the values upfront. The yield statement is typically used within a loop in a generator function, and each time it is encountered, the function's state is saved, and the yielded value is returned. The function can then be resumed from where it left off the next time it is iterated.\n",

    "5. What is the relationship between map calls and list comprehensions? Make a comparison and\n",
    "contrast between the two.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Both map calls and list comprehensions are used to transform data in a concise and expressive way. However, there are some differences between them:\n",
    "\n",
    "Structure: List comprehensions have a more compact and readable syntax, enclosed in square brackets, and create a new list by applying an expression to each item in an iterable. Map calls, on the other hand, use the map() function and take an iterable and a function as arguments, returning an iterator that applies the function to each item.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eager vs. Lazy Evaluation: List comprehensions perform eager evaluation, meaning they generate the entire resulting list at once. Map calls, when used alone, return a map object, which is an iterator that lazily evaluates the values as they are requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applicability: List comprehensions are more suitable for simple transformations or filtering operations that can be expressed concisely. Map calls, with a separate function, are more flexible and can handle more complex operations, as the function can be defined separately and reused.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance: In some cases, map calls can offer performance advantages over list comprehensions, especially when dealing with large datasets. This is due to the lazy evaluation nature of map calls, which avoids creating an intermediate list, reducing memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, list comprehensions are often favored for their readability and simplicity, while map calls with functions provide more flexibility and laziness in evaluation. The choice between them depends on the specific use case and personal preference.\n",
