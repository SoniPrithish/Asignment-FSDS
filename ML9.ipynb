    "Feature engineering refers to the process of creating new features or transforming existing features in a dataset to improve the performance of machine learning models. It involves extracting relevant information, reducing dimensionality, handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. The key aspects of feature engineering include:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Feature Extraction: Creating new features from existing data by applying domain knowledge or mathematical operations. For example, extracting the day of the week or month from a date variable, or computing interaction terms between existing variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Feature Transformation: Applying mathematical functions to the features to make them more suitable for modeling. This can include log transformations, square roots, or scaling features to a specific range.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Handling Missing Data: Dealing with missing values by imputing or removing them appropriately based on the nature of the data and the analysis objectives.\n",

    "Feature selection aims to identify the most relevant subset of features from a given dataset. The goal is to improve model performance, reduce overfitting, and enhance interpretability. Feature selection methods can be categorized into three types: filter methods, wrapper methods, and embedded methods.\n",

    "a. Filter Methods: These methods evaluate the relevance of features based on statistical measures or domain knowledge, independent of the learning algorithm. Examples include variance threshold, correlation coefficient, or mutual information. Filter methods are computationally efficient but may not consider the interaction between features or the specific learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Wrapper Methods: These methods select features based on their impact on the performance of a specific learning algorithm. They employ a search algorithm combined with cross-validation to evaluate subsets of features. Examples include recursive feature elimination (RFE) or forward/backward selection. Wrapper methods are computationally expensive but can consider feature interactions and model-specific performance.\n",

They optimize feature selection during model training, such as Lasso regularization or decision tree-based feature importance. Embedded methods are computationally efficient and capture feature interactions but may be limited to specific algorithms.\n",
