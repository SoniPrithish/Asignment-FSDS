    "The Bayesian interpretation of probability is a statistical framework that treats probability as a measure of subjective belief or degree of confidence in an event or hypothesis. It involves updating and revising probabilities based on new evidence or information. In the Bayesian approach, probability is viewed as a representation of uncertainty rather than a long-term frequency.\n",
