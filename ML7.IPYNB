    "he target function, also known as the objective function or ground truth, represents the ideal mapping or relationship between the input variables and the output variable in a machine learning problem. It defines the desired output given a set of inputs. In real-life examples, the target function can vary depending on the problem. For instance, in a spam email classification task, the target function would map email features (inputs) to the binary classification of spam or not spam (output). The fitness of a target function is typically assessed by comparing its predicted outputs with the true outputs in a dataset. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or mean squared error can be used to measure the fitness of the target function.\n",

They learn patterns and relationships from a training dataset, which consists of input-output pairs, and generalize that knowledge to make predictions on unseen data. Examples of predictive models include linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks. Descriptive models, on the other hand, aim to summarize or describe patterns in the data without predicting specific outputs. They are used for exploratory data analysis, visualization, and pattern recognition. Examples of descriptive models include clustering algorithms (k-means, hierarchical clustering), dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, t-SNE), and association rule mining.\n",

    "Precision: It quantifies the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of the total predicted positive instances. Precision is calculated as TP / (TP + FP).\n",

    "    i. Underfitting in machine learning occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data. It leads to high bias and low variance, resulting in poor performance on both the training and test data. The most common reason for underfitting is using a model with insufficient complexity, such as using a linear model to fit a nonlinear relationship in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ii. Overfitting happens when a model becomes too complex and fits the training data too closely, capturing noise or random fluctuations. It results in low bias but high variance, leading to excellent performance on the training data but poor generalization to unseen data. Overfitting can occur when a model is too flexible, when the training data is noisy or contains outliers, or when the model is trained for too long, among other reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "    iii. The bias-variance trade-off refers to the relationship between a model's bias (ability to capture the true underlying pattern) and its variance (sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training data). Models with high bias are typically simpler and have low complexity, while models with high variance are more complex and capture noise in the data. Finding the right balance between bias and variance is essential for building a model that generalizes well to unseen data.\n",

    "The eager learner vs. the lazy learner: The eager learner, also known as the eager classifier, builds a classification model during the training phase and generalizes from the training instances. It constructs a specific representation of the learned knowledge, which is then used for prediction. In contrast, the lazy learner, also known as the lazy classifier, defers the learning process until a prediction is required. It simply stores the training instances and, during prediction, searches for the most similar instances to make decisions. Lazy learners have a more flexible representation and can adapt to changing data dynamics.\n",
